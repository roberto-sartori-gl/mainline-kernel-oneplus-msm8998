description: |-
  The Sony IMX300 is a 1/2.3-inch Stacked CMOS (Exmor-RS) digital image
  sensor with a pixel size of 1.08um and an active array size of
  5948H x 4140V. It is programmable through I2C interface at address 0x10.
  Image data is sent through MIPI CSI-2, which is configured as either 2 or
  4 data lanes.
